Being a world of warcraft player for many years and having recently graduated with a master's degree in data science I was wondering on what subject I could work on. 
While wandering on the wow website I realized that an important number of images were available and that it would be possible to use my knowledge of the game as well as my professional skills to realize a project of artificial intelligence from these gifts.

The purpose of this project is to work and use some Data Sciences skills with a fun and personal subject, enjoy it !

Main steps :
 - firstly I download a large dataset using Web Scraping (character's images with their features, for example "Orc", "Horde", ...) : one databe is store **here :** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jQmVFVDiBfFnWIGnOfJNonF2-bA6xQS5?usp=sharing
