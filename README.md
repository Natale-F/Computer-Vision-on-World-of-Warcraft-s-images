# Computer Vision on World of Warcraft's images

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/4/42/World_of_Warcraft_Shadowlands_Logo.png)

Being a World of Warcraft player for many years and recently graduated with a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science. I was wondering on what subject I could do a project. 
While wandering on the WoW website I realized that an important number of images were available and that it would be possible to use my knowledge of the game as well as my professional skills to realize a project of Artificial Intelligence from these images.

How did I realise that I could do something with this data ? 

See for yourself some examples!



Gnome (Alliance)             |  Tauren (Horde)

Human (Alliance)             |   Orc (Horde)
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

We can clearly distinguish differences between these characters as a human (skin colour, texture, face, size, ...). The purpose of this project is to work and use some Data Sciences skills with a fun and personal subject in order to allow an AI algorithm to identify these characteristics that we naturally distinguish.

**Enjoy it !**

 # Main steps :
 - **Download a large dataset using Web Scraping** (character's images with their features, for example "Orc", "Horde", ...). 
    - "recovery_players_names.ipynb" retrieves the names and servers of the 50 000 best EU players (items level) and store these informations in a DataFrame
    - "image_download.ipynb" use the previous DataFrame to retrives more informations about these players and store character's images.
      One of the 2 downloads database can be download **here :** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jQmVFVDiBfFnWIGnOfJNonF2-bA6xQS5?usp=sharing
 - **Data formatting** prepares the downloaded data and formats it in a format useful for machine learning. 
    - "data_extracting.ipynb" : prepares the "labels information" for the 2 previously downloaded bases and saves it in csv documents.
